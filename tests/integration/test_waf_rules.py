"""Phase 2 item 3 -- the WAF (ModSecurity + OWASP CRS, PARANOIA 1, anomaly
threshold 10) actually blocks common attacks on a real tenant host, and does
not block ordinary browsing (no false positives on realistic traffic).

Traffic path exercised end to end: client -> edge Caddy -> edge nginx ->
Main waf-nginx:8080 (ModSecurity/CRS) -> frp tunnel -> qa-echo. A 403 here is
the WAF's anomaly block; a JSON body from qa-echo (is_origin_response) means
the request passed the WAF and reached the origin.

The `shield` fixture forces qa1's CAPTCHA/OTP off first, so a 403 can only be
the CRS anomaly block, never a challenge gate, and a benign GET is not turned
into a 401/challenge.
